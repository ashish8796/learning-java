Need to create a deep copy method for student object using prototype design pattern for students
Students can be part of different batches. Handle this situation using Registry Design Pattern

Student should have the following properties
    1. name
    2. email
    3. phoneNumber
    4. yearOfEnrollment
    5. batchName
    6. moduleName
    7. instructorName
    8. moduleStartDate
    9. moduleEndDate
    10. moduleSchedule

Solution -
    1. interface with a generic -> clone()
    2. Any class that needs to follow prototype -> implements the interface
    3. write the clone() -> call a specific copy constructor which copies the set
    of attributes will remain common across a lot of objects
    4. use the clone() to create copies of the prototype

    5. Maintain multiple prototypes of a class -> Registry -> class with a hashmap
